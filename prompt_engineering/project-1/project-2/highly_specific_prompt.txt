Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are intended to protect domestic industries by raising the cost of foreign goods. Economists generally view them as inefficient, often leading to higher consumer prices as importers pass on costs. Former President Trump advocated for tariffs, claiming they would create jobs and reduce the federal deficit. However, studies show that his tariffs did not significantly boost U.S. employment and led to retaliatory measures from other countries, harming industries like agriculture. Despite economic drawbacks, Trump's tariff policies were politically successful, increasing support in manufacturing-heavy regions. Tariffs can also be used as leverage for non-trade issues, reflecting their broader strategic use.
