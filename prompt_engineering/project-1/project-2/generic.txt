### Summary of the Article

The article discusses the concept of tariffs, their implementation, and their impact, particularly focusing on the policies and statements of former U.S. President Donald Trump.

**Key Points:**

1. **Definition and Collection:**
   - Tariffs are taxes on imports, typically charged as a percentage of the import price. In the U.S., they are collected by Customs and Border Protection.

2. **Economic Perspective:**
   - Economists generally view tariffs as inefficient for raising government revenue. They often lead to higher prices for consumers as importers pass on the costs.

3. **Trump's Stance:**
   - Trump has been a strong proponent of tariffs, claiming they benefit the U.S. economy by creating jobs and reducing the federal deficit. He imposed tariffs on various goods, including those from China, steel, and aluminum.

4. **Impact and Retaliation:**
   - Tariffs can hurt foreign economies by making their products more expensive. However, they often lead to retaliation from other countries, which can harm U.S. industries and consumers.

5. **Historical Context:**
   - Before the federal income tax, tariffs were a major source of U.S. government revenue. However, their significance has diminished with the growth of global trade.

6. **Political Use:**
   - Trump has used tariffs as a political tool, leveraging them to pressure countries on various issues, including immigration and trade practices.

7. **Economic Studies:**
   - Studies have shown that Trump's tariffs did not significantly increase U.S. employment in targeted sectors like steel. Instead, retaliatory tariffs from other countries negatively impacted U.S. industries, particularly agriculture.

8. **Political Success:**
   - Despite mixed economic outcomes, Trump's tariff policies were politically successful, increasing support for him and Republican candidates in areas affected by the tariffs.
