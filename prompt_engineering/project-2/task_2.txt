Task: Explain Quantum Physics with Jokes
Vague Prompt:
"Explain quantum physics and include jokes."

Analysis of Response:

Issues:
Too broad: Quantum physics is a complex topic, and without specifying which aspects to focus on, the explanation might be too general.
Lack of context for jokes: It's unclear what kind of jokes to include or how they should relate to quantum physics.
Refined Prompt:
"Explain the concept of superposition in quantum physics in a way that is accessible to a general audience. Include a couple of light-hearted jokes related to the uncertainty or weirdness of quantum mechanics to make the explanation engaging."
